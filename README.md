HR analytics case study from MGMT 4780 (Spring 2025) analyzing the impact of employee engagement and turnover on profit, sales, and customer experience for a gas station retail chain.
# Background Overview
Henshaw's is a fictional convenience store and gas station chain operating in the Southeastern United States. This project was conducted in the context of an HR analytics consulting simulation to explore the relationship between employee culture, engagement, turnover, and store-level performance. As part of the analysis, data was collected and merged from multiple business domains, including labor risk assessments, financial performance, employee surveys, and customer satisfaction.
The primary goal was to derive actionable business insights for stakeholders by identifying which factors most strongly correlate with or predict profitability, turnover, and customer experience outcomes.
